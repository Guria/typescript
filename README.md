# Northbrook TypeScript

> The power of Northbrook and TypeScript together in one place

This is a home to a number of official TypeScript plugins for Northbrook.

This is the first monorepo to make use of northbrook itself, and will be the
source of many bug fixes and great polish to the system Northbrook already provides.

To find more information about each plugin take a look at the README in each
plugin directory.
